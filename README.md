# DynamicPage

    The readme of this document is going to be use to explain the path took to get where
    we got. Principally after working different methods, on my base file i decide todo a simple graphic
    scafold where with a click you get extra information of each of the team
    members, that in this case i choose to give it a role to my wife, since she actually
    do have a role haha. 

    Sice the information that i want to populate was in diferent places of the screen i started 
    orginizing the file in row with flex and making the markup as...
    
    | Space(where the info goes) | Picture Button Gonzalo | Picture Button Liss | Space(where the info goes) |
    
    and thats why i decide that i was going to be better to create an array to a toggle
    action where the info gets populate with the click and took it out with the second click.
