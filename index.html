        <p class="Gparagraph">was born in Cali, Colombia, and raised in Palmira. Since I was a little kid Iâ€™ve always been really into artistic and manual stuff, my passion when I was a youngman was playing with clay, i used to do it everyday with my dad, he was the real artist at that time. Since then as any other human I have been going through different circumstances and now I'm a professional Visual Communication Designer from the Javeriana University in Cali, Colombia and nowadays I'm studying Interactive Media Design at Fanshawe College in Canada.</p>
